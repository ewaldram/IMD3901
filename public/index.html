        ASSIGNMENT NOTES
        I'm very aware that this is a not pretty, non-functioning piece. 
        My goal is to document very clearly on what I'm attempting to create,
        and ideally earn  a couple half marks for what I'm trying to complish.
        I'm really very sorry it's so  broken after the extra time given.
        Strangely, I think it's due to the HTML/Java bits, and less the sockets, though learning
        sockets has certainly been a challenge in and of itself, even with your lecture.
